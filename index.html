                    As part of its ongoing YouTube documentary series tracking the progress of the Precept 
                    concept reaching full production, Polestar has confirmed the EV will be called the Polestar 
                    5. The third episode of Precept: from Concept to Car also offers a glimpse at the final design 
                    of the Polestar 5, which is stated for production in 2024.

                        Polestar is a premium electronic car brand launched in 2017 as an independent venture 
                        co-owned by both Volvo Cars Group and Geely Holding Group. Since then, it has delivered 
                        one PHEV in the Polestar 1, and the all-electric Polestar 2 which is now seeing revamped 
                        2022 models roll out.

                        Polestar's Precept EV was announced in early 2020 as a concept vehicle that represented 
                        the future of the company's electrified models. The concept must have been well-received, 
                        because just months later, Polestar announced it would be brought to full-fledged production.
